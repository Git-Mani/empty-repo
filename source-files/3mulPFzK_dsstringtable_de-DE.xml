This simulation can be expected to run faster on identical hardware if additional RAM or a faster hard drive configuration is made available.  For more details, please see the Ansys Performance Guide which is part of the Ansys Help system.</string>

To avoid a zero-length beam element, an additional node was created to tie the nodes together.  As a result, the stiffness of the connection may be slightly reduced at that location.  You may graphically display FE Connections from the Solution Information Object to visualize these connections.</string>

    This is the "Load Step Activation" view for &lt;em&gt;Table-defined&lt;/em&gt; Loads.
    It is used to activate or deactivate the selected Loads at corresponding load steps.
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    The columns that are displayed will change depending on the selected Loads in the Tree/Outline view.
    At a minimum, the "Load Step" and "Active" columns will be shown.
    The "Load Step" cells specifies the load step for that row.
    When multiple Loads are selected, a "Boundary Condition" column be shown.
    The "Boundary Condition" cells contain the names of the Loads affected by that row.
    When Loads from different Analyses are selected, an "Analysis" column will be shown.
    The "Analysis" cells show the parent Analysis for the Loads specified in the "Boundary Condition" column.
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    The "Active" column cells contain a checkbox that is used to activate or deactivate the corresponding Load(s) at that time step.
    Each checkboxe has three possible states: "Activated", "Deactivated", and "Indeterminate".
    The visual appearance and meaning of these states is shown below.
    Note that the header for the "Active" column also includes a master checkbox.
    This master checkbox can be used to uniformly activate or deactivate all selected Loads at each load step.
